      <p>Philippians 4:6

Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.
And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>Matthew 6:34 

Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</p>

<p>1 Peter 5:7 

Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.</p>

<p>Proverbs 3:5 

Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding;
in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.</p>

<p>Psalm 94:19 

When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought me joy.</p>
